              <p className='text-[16px] font-["Roboto"] text-[#ebeced]'>Nimbi, a character with dual existences. In one he is a central figure in the associated Web3 video game Crypto Dust Runner and an artistic representation in the NFT Nimbi Art Collection. The ERC-404 Nimbi Token also bears his name, enhancing his integral role within the ecosystem. In this capacity Nimbi is on a quest to gather members for his Wolfpack, leading them on adventures across the virtual landscape.<br />
                In the other, Nimbi is Mr. Nimbus—a two-year-old White Wolf rescued as a puppy from a reservation. Known as a Res-Wolf Dog, Nimbi's early life on the reservation introduced him to the harsh realities and the concept of "Crypto Dust," a metaphor for the scraps and remnants he survived on. Now thriving in the Rocky Mountains, he embodies resilience and leadership, characteristics that translate into his digital persona where he guides players to the apex of mountains and beyond in Crypto Dust Runner.

                In Crypto Dust Runner, Kazi's role transcends mere play. He is envisioned as a mediator within the game's community, potentially influencing gameplay dynamics where cooperation among players is crucial.

            <p className='text-[16px] font-["Roboto"] text-[#ebeced] text-center'>The point of this web3 nimbi project is to neutralize the market share of the current establishments(ie Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, etc) that are gaining power and market dominance. Large corporations are starting to take over in all sectors. Central authorities all over the world are influenced by large corporations with deep pockets. The voice of us(the people) has been taken away and influenced monetarily to favor them and make them more money. They only have one thing in mind(making money with no regard). We are going to collect our Crypto Dust together and stand tall to be heard and make the change we want as humanity. We will unite all of humanity to make this change together and live a Happy life we all want. We will have fun along the way and connect with friends all over the world. Join Nimbi's Wolfpack where he and Kazi have made this a top priority.</p>
